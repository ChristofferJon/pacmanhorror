What if higher dimensions hide things that exist and walk amongst us?
What if we could traverse through space in these higher dimensions?
What if the mazes we move through is but a pill in a bigger maze?
If you one day woke up to these questions as the truth, would you
have the presence of mind to realize that if pills got you into
this maze, then pills have to get you out of it.
